CS349 A3 Marking Scheme
Marker: Dallas Fraser

Marks in [] are the total marks for an item.
Marks in () are used to denote the breakdown of marks for that particular item.

Deliverables (5%)
[5/5] Typing "make run" compiles and launches the application (5).

Basic functionality (20%)
[5/5] There exists a menu bar at the top of the window (5).
[5/5] The menu bar contains the menu "File" (1), with the items "Reset" and
      "Quit" (2), each using the appropriate accelerator keys (2).
[5/5] The "Reset" menu option resets the ragdoll's position entirely to the
      default. (5)
[5/5] A ragdoll is visible (2), and is assembled in the rough shape of the doll (3).

Translation (15%)
[5/5] The ragdoll can be translated (5).
[5/5] The ragdoll can be translated with direct manipulation on the torso (3), with
      movements that match the mouse's movement one-to-one (2).
[5/5] When the ragdoll is translated by the torso, the child elements of the torso
      are translated simultaneously (5).

Rotation (20%)
[5/5] All body parts of the ragdoll can be rotated (4), except for the torso, which
      does not rotate (1).
[5/5] The parts can be rotated with direct manipulation on the body part (3), with
      rotations that match the mouse's rotation about the pivot one-to-one (2).
[5/5] When the body parts are rotated, the child elements of the body part are
      rotated simultaneously (5).
[5/5] The appropriate body parts have limited rotation (3), relative to the
      rotation of their parent element (2).

Scaling (20%)
[5/5] The legs of the ragdoll can be scaled (4), and no other body parts can be (1).
[5/5] The legs can be scaled with direct manipulation (3), with scaling that matches
      the mouse's distance from the pivot (2).
[5/5] When the upper legs are scaled, the lower legs are scaled as well (4), but
     the feet are not scaled (1).
[5/5] The legs scale along their primary axis (3), even when the lower leg has been
      rotated relative to the upper leg (2).

Robustness (10%)
[2/2] Grabbing a body part for direct manipulation does not cause the body part
      to change at all until the mouse begins to move (2).
[5/5] The movement of body parts is smooth while they're being directly
      manipulated within constraints (5). (It is acceptable for the body part to
      "pop" if you move past one constraint and back into range.)
[3/3] When a body part is manipulated, the child elements of the body part are
      also updated smoothly (3).


Enhancements (15%)
Textures:
Did see any, the notes in the readme did not indicate an enhancements for the program
105 - 15
Total:
[90/100]

Note: Your total may be above 100 if a 15-mark enhancement is implemented.
